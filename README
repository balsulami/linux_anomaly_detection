Name
sys_sensor - a program to collect system calls traces from Linux Kernel.

Synopsis
sys_sensor  start [-l] |
			[-h host:port] |
			[-o path_to_output_file] |
			status -h host:port |
			stop   

Description
sys_sensor is a program for collecting system calls traces from ftrace, a Linux kernel internal tracer. sys_sensor turns on the tracing and runs as a
background process (daemon). sys_sensor writes the collected traces to a remote server, a local file, or a console. 

Options
===============================================================
start
	start sys_sensor for collecting system calls traces.
-l
	enable sys_sensor to show states on the program performance. The stats can be retrieved by using the argument 'status'.
-o
	writes the system calls traces to a local file.
-h
	writes the system calls traces to a remote server.
================================================================
status
	show states on the program performance. This can't work without starting the program with '-l' option.
-h
	connect to the remote sensor and show its states.
================================================================
stop
	stop sys_sensor and turn off the tracing.

Examples
- To start tracing a machine and write the traces to a file
sys_sensor start -o /tmp/traces.log

- To start tracing a machine and write the traces to a remote server 10.0.0.15 port 35678
sys_sensor start -h 10.0.0.15:35678

- To show stats of this sensor:
sys_sensor status -h 10.0.0.15:35678

- To stop a sensor:
sys_sensor stop
